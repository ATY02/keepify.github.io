        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>Subscriptions Flow AI is a Shopify application that tackles subscription churn - the constant loss of subscribers
            due to cancellation or expiration. This is an issue that reduces merchants' predictable revenue, and in turn can 
            make or break any of the 5.6 million active Shopify businesses. Subscriptions Flow AI supports merchants by 
            allowing them to intervene whenever a customer has a high risk of canceling, evaluated by ChurnGuard - an AI model
            that can predict a customer's churn risk. Based on this analysis, merchants will have the ability to initiate 
            upsell methods to attempt to retain customers, such as offering them a discount. Store owners can also create 
            custom discount offers based on delivery and subscription intervals. Depending on merchant needs, the application 
            can be extended to support increased automation - streamlining their experience by suggesting personalized 
            strategies for customer retention.</p>
